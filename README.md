## Overview

The console portion of this assignment has just four objects. A joshua object an altima object and a pineTree and oakTree obejcts.

### Syntax

all of the objects can speak() to let you know how they're doing.

joshua can .hitAtree(), .lock(), .unlock(), and .goFindKeys(). 

altima can .hitAtree()

joshua has his keys at first, but .hitAtree() makes him loose them. He can only lock and unlock the altima if he has his keys. Fortunately, he can .goFindKeys()

Both he and the car can .hitAtree() and the consequences are the same....He never forgets
